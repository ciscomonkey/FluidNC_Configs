# FluidNC_Configs

These are the FluidNC configuration files I have in use on my machines.  Both machines are using the [Jackpot CNC Controller](https://www.v1e.com/products/jackpot-cnc-controller) from V1 Engineering.

## MPCNC Router

I have the Primo version of the MPCNC.  This was upgraded from the Burly version which ran on a Rambo with LCD.  As the Jackpot controller does not have a display option, I added the [M5 FluidDial Pendant](http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/hardware/official/M5Dial_Pendant).  

I am using the [FluidDial Connection Starter Kit](https://www.tindie.com/products/33366583/fluiddial-connection-starter-kit/) in this pendant. If you use this kit, make sure you are ordering/using the correct cable! You will need a 6P6C cable.

## Laser

I recycled an old Folgertech 3D printer (built with 2020 extrusion) into a small laser engraver/cutter using a 10W diode I got from Amazon.  I added an adjustable bed as the Z axis, and also built out a basic rotary axis that runs on the A axis.  This machine does not have a pendant as it's normally being controlled from LightBurn.
